TypeScript-Game
===============

This is a game made using Microsoft's new super-set of Javascript called [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org), with a simple [HTML 5](http://www.w3.org/html/logo/) canvas.

It will all be custom code, I won't be using any (hopefully) external api's. I wan't to see what I can make in just TypeScript (really just javascript) and canvas.

### How to Run
To run this, just download the repository as a .zip or anything and open the file "typescript.html" in any web browser.
